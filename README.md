# Bouncing Balls
This is a cool little project that I built using Javascript. Essentially it's balls bouncing in a confined space environment, I have done this project to improve on my existing skills. I find this project to be quite interesting and so I decided to refactor previous code to improve and optimise it, for example I randomised the velocity for each generated ball.

# Learning Experience
This was a great project to practice Javascript Classes, HTML Canvas and button event listeners. 

# Areas for improvement 
• Add gravity to balls <br>
• Add varying ball sizes <br>
• Implement additional styles (trails) <br>
• Sound Effects
• Collision
