# Bouncing Balls
This is a cool bouncing balls project that I built using Javascript. I find this project to be quite interesting and so I decided to refactor previous code to improve and optimise it.

# Learning Experience
This was a great project to practice Javascript Classes, HTML Canvas and button event listeners.

# Areas for improvement 
• Add gravity to balls <br>
• Add varying ball sizes <br>
• Implement additional styles (trails) <br>
